# About Me

My name is Daniel Shapiro, and I'm a master's student in the REECA (Regional Studies: Russia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia) program at Harvard's Davis Center. I study contemporary Russian politics and economics, as well as the geopolitics of the Caucasus. This project is for my GOV 1006 (Models) class at Harvard.
